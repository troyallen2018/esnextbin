## How it works?

- The code gets transpiled by latest version of [Babel.js](http://babeljs.io/) with `stage-0`, `es2015` and `react` presets enabled.
- [Browserify-CDN](https://wzrd.in/) is responsible for importing npm modules and browserifying them on the fly.
- [Github Gists]https://gist.github.com/() for saving and sharing code sketches.

Under the hood it's a pure client-side application which is hosted on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) and is built upon [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/).
